# SCF-calculation
The project involved developing a Fortran90 computational code to solve the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations for the ground state of the helium atom using the SCF-LCAO-MO method. The primary goal was to write a code capable of solving these equations with a double-zeta basis set (M = 2) and Slater coefficients α1 = 1.45 and α2 = 2.90.
The development process followed the project guidelines, with each step designed to address specific questions from the project brief. While I developed the main code independently, I used subroutines provided by the course professor. The final results were compared to those presented in the paper "A Simple Illustration of the SCF-LCAO-MO Method" by R. L. Snow and J. L. Bills (August 1, 1975) to validate the accuracy of the code.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Fortran code using a Fortran compiler.
2. Run the executable to obtain the results.
